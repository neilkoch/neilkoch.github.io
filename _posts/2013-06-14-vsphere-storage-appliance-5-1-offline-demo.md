Recently a client ask about seeing a demonstration of VMware vSphere Storage Appliance in action. I didn&#8217;t have a live production or development to demo this setup on however, luckily there is a offline demo tool available direct through VMware to assist with this task.<!--more-->

Using the VSA 5.1 Offline Demo you can go through the process of setting up a VSA cluster and getting a general overview of how the process works. Further documentation on the vSphere Storage Appliance overview is available on VMware&#8217;s website [here](http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vsphere/vsphere-storage-appliance/resources.html)Â and it gives some great examples how how you could use VSA&#8217;s in a production environment.
