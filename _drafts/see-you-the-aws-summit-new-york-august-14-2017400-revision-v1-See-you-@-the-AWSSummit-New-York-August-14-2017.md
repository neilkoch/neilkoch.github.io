I&#8217;m looking forward the [AWS Summit](https://aws.amazon.com/summits/new-york/) next Monday, August 14 in New York City. There&#8217;s rumored to be around 9000 guests registered so it&#8217;s going to be huge! I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be lots to learn from AWS given their breath of solution offerings. I&#8217;m particularly interested in two areas, Amazon AI and Amazon Machine learning. Very interested to see how these solutions (which there are around 10 different ones) can be applied in the financial sector for my clients and organizations looking at advancing their existing in-house built tool sets for financial data mining. If you&#8217;re going to be there too, let me know via the comments.
