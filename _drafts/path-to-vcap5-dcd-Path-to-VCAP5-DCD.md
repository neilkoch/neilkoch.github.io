<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Recently I made the decision to pursue one of VMware&#8217;s higher certifications, the VMware Certified Advanced Professional in vSphere 5 &#8211; Data Design or simply, VCAP5-DCD. From what I have read online to date this will certainly be one of the toughest certification exams I have taken. The time allowed for the exam is little under 4 hours (225 minutes) in the industry it&#8217;s compared to Cisco&#8217;s CCIE programs if you are familiar with that certification route. After reviewing and reading a wealth of material available on all the blogs, books, and guides online my plan is as follows (I&#8217;ll keep this updated as I find or use more sources online). Presently I&#8217;m looking at taking the exam if all goes to plan in March, 2014.
