  You&#8217;re working in the IT department at Massive Mega Corporation and the CEO storms storms into the room (most likely the basement). They&#8217;re furious! The servers are down and the sales people at the 500+ branches can&#8217;t access the ERP system to process orders. The company is literately dead in the water.<!--more-->
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  What is the CEO thinking? They&#8217;re thinking what is this costing us per hour (100 sites x 20 employees per site x hourly rate  + the time it takes for manual data entry into the system once it&#8217;s back online)? A lot! But instead asking why this is happening they yell and scream and ask you to fix it now! You sweat, you claim ignorance, did you know already know this about was going to happen?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This scenario, although quite possibly a little over the top is somewhat realistic. IT Departments are put under a great deal of pressure to provide continual non-interrupted support. They are expected to provide support for a multifaceted environment with servers, switchers, routers, firewalls, storage systems and then the software running it all; Windows Server, Linux, proprietary applications, etc. Most likely they are running in different monitoring systems too, different clouds, different alerts, alarms, triggers, you name it!

  So you&#8217;re probably thinking&#8230; OK so what&#8217;s your point? A great example of some things that might assist you in being an &#8216;Awesome VMware Sys Admin&#8217; is Automation. The key to improving any environment. On the forefront of your mind should be &#8216;Will I repeat this task again?&#8217;, &#8216;Can I use a script to complete this task?&#8217;,
